# PyBer Analysis
## Purpose
<br/>
The purpose of this assignment was to perform exploratory analysis of data for PyBer, a Python-based ride sharing company. This analysis was performed to discover the relationship between city types, drivers and riders as well as the total fares by riders, drivers and city type. The ultimate goal of this analysis is to help PyBer improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighbourhoods.

Based on the analysis, it is absolutely conclusive that the Urban cities drive the greatest proportion of fares for PyBer, as demonstrated in the % Fares by City Type pie chart. These high fares are likely the result of:
 
  1. The highest number of Total Drivers.
  2. The highest number of Total Rides.

We can infer that both of these variables are due to greater population sizes in Urban Cities. 

Although Urban cities are the primary fare drivers, the Rural cities yield significantly higher Average Fare per Driver and Average Fare per Ride. The Rural cities likely have lower population sizes, which impacts the Total Rides and Total Drivers. At the same time, the Rural city Rides are likely to be of greater distance and time than in the Suburbs. In addition to this, Rural city dweller might be more likely to have their own car/vehicle due to a more spread-out geography and potential lack of public transit.   

Suburban cities consistently fall in the middle of Rural and Urban cities from a statistical perspective. Suburban cities maintain a very similar Total Ride to Total Drivers ratio as Rural Cities, however both of these metrics are approximately 5x greater in Suburban cities. As a result, Suburban cities generate a significant higher Average Fare per Driver than the Urban cities. 

For a deeper look into the variations in fare by city type, see the Total Fair by City Type visualization below.

## Summary

Based on this analysis, I would make the following business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among city types.

 1. First, I would advise a deeper analysis into the Urban City types, knowing that there is likely competition with other Ride Sharing Apps. Based on this, it would benefit Pyber to have a greater understanding of how many Ride Share users there are in the Urban Cities they operate within. This date would provide greater insight into how they can elevate their services and increase the Total Ride number in relation to the Total Drivers. If the Urban cities were able to reach the same Total Rides to Total Drivers ratio as the Suburban city type, the Average Fare per Driver would increase to approximately $29.44 followed by a $30,000 increase in Total Fares.   

 2. In the interest of improving access to ride sharing services, I would recommend that PyBer creates a strategy to increase their Total Drivers in Rural cities. If PyBer drivers are more accessible in these cities, the population might be more apt to join the ride sharing app. 

 3. After increasing Total Drivers in Rural cities, I would also recommend adjusting the pricing architecture in Suburban and Rural neighbourhoods. Knowing that riders are more likely to be travelling greater distances in these city types, reducing the Average Fare per Ride could increase the overall Total Rides, as well as the overall Total Fares.
