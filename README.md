# PyBer Analysis
## Purpose
<br/>
The purpose of this assignment was to perform exploratory analysis of data for PyBer, a Python-based ride sharing company. This analysis was performed to discover the realtionship between city types, drivers and riders as well as the total fares by riders, drivers and city type. The ultimate goal of this analysis is to help Pyber improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighbourhoods.

Based on the analysis, it is absolutely conclusive that the Urban cities drive the greatest perportion of fares for Pyber, as demonstrated in the % Fares by City Type pie chart. These high fares are likely the result of:
 
  1. The highest number of Total Drivers.
  2. The higest number of Total Rides.

We can infer that both of these variables are due to greater population sizes in Urban Cities. 

Although Urban cities are the primary fare drivers, the Rural cities yield significantly higher Average Fare per Driver and Average Fare per Ride. The Rural cities likely have lower population sizes, which impacts the Total Rides and Total Drivers. At the same time, the Rural city Rides are likely of a signifantly greater distance and time than in the Suburbs. In addition to this, Rural city dweller might be more likely to have their own car/vehicle due to a more spread-out geography and potential lack of public transit.   

Suburban cities consistently fall in the middle of Rural and Urban cities from a statistical perspective. Suburban cities maitain a very similar Total Ride to Total Drivers ratio as Rural Cities, however both of these metrics are approximately 5x greater in Suburban cities. As a result, Suburban cities generate a significant hight Average Fare per Driver than the Urban cities. 

For a deeper look into the variations in fare by city type, see the Total Fair by City Type visualization below.

## Summary

Based on this analysis, I would make the following business recommendations 
1. Further analysis to determine population size and density. 

2. Increase the price the price per ride. 

3. Adjust pricing architechture in suburban and rural neighbourhoods.
